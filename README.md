# Friends Frenzy – Logic Engine Prototype

Friends Frenzy is a browser-based prototype focusing on the implementation of a structured multiplayer game logic engine.

This repository contains the core interaction system, turn resolution logic, and state management design.

---

## Project Focus

This prototype demonstrates:

- Simultaneous action commitment
- Minority-based resolution system
- Structured round execution flow
- Controlled state mutation
- Spell interaction handling logic

The emphasis of this version is system architecture and logical consistency rather than visual assets.

---

## Asset Notice

To keep the repository lightweight and focused on code structure, non-essential visual assets have been removed.

The current public version may not display full UI elements due to omitted image resources.

However, all core logic and state-handling mechanisms are fully implemented and functional in the local development environment.

---

## System Design Highlights

- Centralized game state object
- Deterministic round lifecycle
- Validation before state mutation
- Edge-case handling for multi-player resolution
- Modular function structure
